## Goals of Data Analysis

1. Understand customer preferences regarding ingredients in their orders.
2. Evaluate driver efficiency and identify areas for improvement.
3. Analyze order patterns to optimize delivery schedules and staffing.
4. Optimize ingredient usage to reduce waste and operational costs.

## Insights Drawn from the Project

1. Sales Trends Over Time
Monthly/Weekly Sales Analysis: By querying the data over different time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), you can uncover trends in pizza sales. For instance, you may find that sales peak during weekends or holidays.
Seasonal Patterns: You might observe increased sales in certain months, like December due to holidays, or summer months when people tend to dine out more often.


2. Best-Selling Pizzas
Top Pizza Varieties: By grouping sales data by pizza type, you can identify which pizza varieties (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni, Veggie) are the most popular.
Customization Trends: Analyzing customer preferences for specific toppings, crust types, or sizes can offer valuable insight into what customers are looking for.

3. Revenue Analysis
Profitability per Pizza: By joining sales and cost data (e.g., ingredient cost, labor cost), you can determine the profitability of each pizza type.
Discount Impact: If discounts or promotional offers are applied, you can analyze whether they actually boost sales or hurt overall profitability.


4. Order Sizes and Pricing Insights
Average Order Value: By calculating the average sale per order, you can gauge customer spending behavior. It may be insightful to determine whether people order just one pizza or multiple items.
Price Sensitivity: Analyzing the effect of different price points on sales volume could provide insight into optimal pricing strategies.


5. Order Fulfillment and Delivery Efficiency
Delivery vs. In-store Sales: By distinguishing between sales made in-store and those placed for delivery, you can identify whether customers prefer home delivery or if there are bottlenecks in the delivery system.
Delivery Time Analysis: Examining how long it takes for orders to be fulfilled and delivered can highlight areas for operational improvement (e.g., faster delivery times could increase customer satisfaction).


6. Customer Feedback and Satisfaction
Ratings and Reviews: If customer feedback (e.g., ratings or reviews) is stored in the database, you can analyze it to identify recurring issues with pizzas, such as complaints about toppings or delivery times.
